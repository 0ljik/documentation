## Learn to build and flash applications to your Carbon Board

It's time to see what your Carbon can do. From here you can learn how to build your own applications, or flash some of our pre-built ones, available on the Downloads page:

- [Downloads page](../downloads/README.md): This page contains prebuilt OS and Application files, simply download and flash to get started!
- [Building for Carbon](../build/README.md): In a few simple steps, here you will learn how to build and flash your own application to the Carbon.
- [Installation page](../installation/README.md): Find instructions on how to flash new applications to your Carbon!
- [Support](../support/README.md)
   - From bug reports and current issues, to forum access and other useful resources, we want to help you find answers
