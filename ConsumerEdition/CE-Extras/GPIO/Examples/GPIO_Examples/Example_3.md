# Example #3 - Sensor, sensors, and more sensors

This public instruction set was created by Barry Byford, a DragonBoard 410c enthusiast from the UK. The code provided for these examples are simple and still being developed. Instructions for setting up the libsoc_zero library can be found on his website along side his sample code and examples.

These examples were made using the [Linker mezzanine card starter kit](../../../MezzanineProducts/Linker%20mezzanine%20card%20starter%20kit/README.md) made by [Arrow](http://www.arrow.com)
