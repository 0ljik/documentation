- **AT&T M2X**
   - AT&T M2X provides time-series data storage, device management, message brokering, event triggering, alarming, geo-fencing,
   and data visualization for network supported industrial Internet of Things (IOT) products and services. You can find instructions
   from Arrow Electronics for getting started with AT&T M2X on GitHub, and to inspire you check out what the grand prize winners of the
   2016 AT&T Hackathon created.
- **AWS Internet of Things **
   - Arrow Electronics is now offering the DragonBoard 410c IoT Starter Kit powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
   This kits helps kick start development with AWS IoT, a managed cloud platform that lets connected devices easily and
   securely interact with cloud apps and other devices. The SDK in the kit includes sample apps that use AWS services, such
   as a node application running on the DragonBoard 410c to send process, disk and network information to
   Amazon’s Simple Storage Service (S3).
- **IBM Watson IoT Platform**
   - Are you ready to build some cognitive computing into your project? Look for the connecting DragonBoard 410c to the IBM
   Watson IoT Platform in Bluemix recipe, IBM’s cloud-based catalog of services. This will allow you to develop an IoT application
   that uses IBM Watson to act on data you collect and send from the DragonBoard 410c.
- **Microsoft Azure IoT Suite**
   - What Windows 10 IoT does at the device level, the Azure IoT Suite does at the cloud level, making it easier for you to 
   deploy and scale up applications like remote monitoring, predictive analytics, asset management and preventive maintenance.
   Since the DragonBoard 410c is Azure Certified, you can tie, say, a remote monitoring project to Azure IoT services. Watch
   this video about health care IoT and sending temperature data from the DragonBoard 410c to Azure.
