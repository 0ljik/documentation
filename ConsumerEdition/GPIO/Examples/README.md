## GPIO Examples

### Example #1

This repository, created by Linaro's David Mandala, demonstrates the use of three different libraries using three different scripts. Instructions on how to compile and execute the code can be found in the README.md file which is included in the repository download. Simply clone the repoistory onto your 96Boards and follow README.md instructions.

These examples were made using the [Linker mezzanine card starter kit](../../../MezzanineProducts) made by [Arrow](http://www.arrow.com)

**Commands:**

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/dmandala/library_test.git<Enter>
$ cd library_test<Enter>
$ cat README.md<Enter>
```

### Example #2

This public instruction set was created by Barry Byford, a DragonBoard 410c enthusiast from the UK. The code provided for these examples are simple and still being developed. Instructions for setting up the libsoc_zero library can be found on his website along side his sample code and examples.
